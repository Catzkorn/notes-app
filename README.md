Team Principles
Don’t Ignore Testing
Always ask for help if you are stuck
The project is for everyone - Everyone understanding the project is important
Overtime - No major implementation changes after 6pm unless otherwise agreed
Spread knowledge
Everyone has the chance to run a standup and retro
Team Goal
Less is more - Don’t over extend the project. Figure out what we want to do and do that very well.
Product Design & Management
Github Projects
A github project board was used to manage the development of this product. This allowed the team to create and assign issues to pairing teams to develop and implement.

Github Project Board

User Stories
Separate sets of user stories were created for each 2 day sprint.

Sprint 1
Sprint 1 user stories

Sprint 2
Sprint 2 user stories

Technologies used
Frontend
The frontend was implemented using the Bootstrap Framework, HTML and CSS.

Sinatra was used as part of our model controller view framework.

Frontend testing was achieved by using the Capybara/rspec testing framework.

Backend
The backend was designed using Ruby and Postgres. Testing for backend methodologies was achieved using the rspec testing framework.

Class Diagrams
Class diagrams were created to give a basic structure to class expectations during the project.

Class Diagrams

Management classes were used to interact with the database by passing in space, booking or user objects.

Space Management class:
Methods:

show all spaces

create space(space_object), with name, price and description

shows user_spaces(user_id)

shows specific spaces view_spaces(space_id)

shows specific spaces according to availability

shows specific spaces according to availability

contains a method for converting string month to a date object

User Management class:
Methods:

has a sign up functionality

has a log in functionality

note that logout functionality is implemented by destroying a session, no need for a method itself.
Booking Management class:
Methods:

show customer bookings

show host listings booked

confirm booking

request booking

show host pending bookings

CRC Diagrams
CRC diagrams were initially created to mock the structure of databases and what datatypes may be suitable for use.

CRC Diagram

MVC Diagram
A MVC diagram was created to visually represent the log between the client, controller, model and viewer.

MVC Diagram

Database
Structure
Test environment consisting of 2 Databases;

makersbnb
makersbnb_test (for testing purposes)
Each database has 3 tables:

Spaces
id
name
description
price
userid
Users
id
email
name
password
Bookings
bookingid
spaceid
guestid
stay_date
confirmation
Security
Userid
User id's are UUIDv4's that were generated using the pgcrypto postgresql extension to prevent userid enumeration.

Passwords
Passwords are stored within the database as bcrypt hashes using the pgcrypto postgresql extension.

This was implemented using this guide.

SQL Injection Protection
Variable interpolation was used to protect against SQL injection. This was achieved by using the pg gem.

Data Integrity
Foreign Key References
The messages table contains a foreign key reference to the users table to ensure that only users that exist in the schema can be added as message authors. If a user were to delete their account, their message history would be removed as a consequence.

Database Methods
Joins
To reduce duplication of data within the tables, join methods were used to gain access to information stored within other tables.

"SELECT bookings.*, users.*, users.name AS user_name, spaces.* FROM bookings LEFT JOIN spaces ON bookings.spaceid = spaces.id LEFT JOIN users ON bookings.guestid = users.id WHERE spaces.userid = $1 AND bookings.confirmation IS NULL;"
This example was used to access user information (name, email, hostid) without explicitly storing that within the booking table.

To set-up databases:
Test database
Run:

psql -c 'CREATE DATABASE makersbnb_test;'
psql -d makersbnb_test -f db/migrations/test_database_setup.sql
Live database
Run:

psql -c 'CREATE DATABASE makersbnb;'
psql -d makersbnb -f db/migrations/database_setup.sql

How to run tests
Run bundle in the directory to install required gems:

charlotte@Charlottes-MBP makersbnb % bundle
Run rspec to test:

charlotte@Charlottes-MBP makersbnb % rspec
How to use
Start local server
run rackup
